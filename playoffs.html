    <p style="text-align: center; padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0; font-size: small;">Updating during the RAPTORS vs. NETS series.</p>

    <h2>HOW THE PLAYOFFS WORK?</h2>
    <p>The 16 highest scoring players from the <a style="color: rgb(206,17,65);" href="games.html">SEASON</a> advance to the playoffs. The form to guess the score for the Raptors' playoff games will be sent directly to the 16 players.</p>

    <p>Since a series can be anywhere between 4 and 7 games, each player is just going to guess the outcome for the elimination (final) game of that series. The score that each player will receive for their guess is going to be calculated using the usual <a style="color: rgb(206,17,65);" href="submit.html">SCORING SYSTEM</a>. However, each player will also receive a bonus for their placement in the regular season and if they guess the game number for the elimination game correctly.

    <p>From there, after every round (e.g. after round 1, the conference semi-finals, etc.), half the players get eliminated. In other words, after round 1, there will be 8 players left, and after the conference finals, there will only be 2 players left.</p>

    <p>If the Raptors' get eliminated before the finals, then whoever has the highest score at that round is the winner...best of luck!</p>
