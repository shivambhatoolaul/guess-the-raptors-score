    <h2>WHAT IS THIS?</h2>
    <p>On March 11th, 2020, the NBA season was suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic. A few months later, it was announced that the season would resume on July 30th, 2020.</p>
    <p>After they released the schedule for the Raptors' 8 remaining games, one of my friends had THE AUDACITY to say that the Raptors would only win 2 out of those 8 games. From there, my other friends started giving their predictions, so I thought it would be interesting to keep score to see who can predict games the best. </p>
    <p>If you also want to be part of the game, make sure to <a style="color: rgb(206,17,65);" href="submit.html">SUBMIT HERE</a>!</p>
    <p>The <a href="index.html"><span style="color: rgb(206,17,65);">LEADERBOARD</span></a> updates soon after every game.</p>
    <p>Good luck!</p>
