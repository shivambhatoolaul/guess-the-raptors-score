    <h2>WHAT IS THIS?</h2>
    <p>On March 11th, 2020, the NBA season was suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic. A few months later, it was announced that the season would resume on July 30th, 2020.</p>
    <p>After they released the schedule for the Raptors' 8 remaining games, one of my friends had THE AUDACITY to say that the Raptors would only win 2 out of those 8 games. From there, my other friends started giving their predictions, so I thought it would be interesting to keep score to see who can predict games the best. </p>

    <br>
    
    <p>As of now, the game is unfortunately no longer accepting submissions, but thank you to everyone that was interested in my project! For the 16 players remaining in the playoffs, best of luck!</p>
