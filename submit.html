      <h2>SCORING SYSTEM?</h2>
        <p>Let's say that the final score for Game 1 was 130-90, but you guessed that the score was going to be 120-100.</p>

        <p>Since you guessed the outcome correctly (W, in this case), you start at <b>+100 points</b>. Wrong guesses start at <b>+75 points</b> instead.</p>

        <p>From there you lose points depending on the actual score vs the score you guessed. </p>

        <p>We calculate this by adding the differences of the absolute values (abs) between the scores. In our case, we would do abs(130-120) + abs(90-100) = 20.</p>

        <p>So, our final score for Game 1 would be +100 points-20 points = 80 points.</p>

        <p><b>The player with the most points at the end of the 8 games wins.</b></p>
